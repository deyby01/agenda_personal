# SOLID Principles Refactoring

**Date Started:** October 12, 2025, 5:58 PM  
**Branch:** refactor/solid-principles-architecture  
**Objective:** Transform codebase to follow SOLID principles  

## Current Architecture Issues:
1. **SRP Violation**: MyWeekView has multiple responsibilities
2. **DRY Violation**: Code duplication between Create/Update views
3. **Tight Coupling**: Views directly coupled to models
4. **Hard Dependencies**: No abstraction layers

## Target Architecture:
1. **Service Layer**: Business logic separation
2. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction  
3. **Clean Views**: Views only handle HTTP concerns
4. **Testable Components**: Each class independently testable

## Safe Migration Strategy:
- ✅ Create new architecture alongside existing code
- ✅ Comprehensive testing at each step
- ✅ Gradual replacement (one component at a time)
- ✅ Rollback capability maintained throughout

## Progress Tracking:
- [ ] Services layer implementation
- [ ] Repository layer implementation
- [ ] Business logic extraction
- [ ] View refactoring
- [ ] Test coverage completion
- [ ] Performance verification
- [ ] Code cleanup

## Safety Measures:
- Working in feature branch (not main)
- Tests written before refactoring
- Old code kept until new code verified
- Gradual migration approach
